# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script
1. First clone the repository 
2. After cloning you need to set up the env in your local machine
3. To set up the env, run the below script in your anaconda command prompt 
	-> conda env create -f env.yml
4. After successfully installing all the required packages
5. Download data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/
6. finally run nonstandarcode.py file.
